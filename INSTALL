If running on a Debian-based OS (this includes Ubuntu), it is highly recommended
to install this program as a package by doing

   ln -fs package_definitions/debian debian
   dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b
   sudo dpkg -i ../feedgnuplot*.deb

This builds a debian package and installs it.

Without a package, an installation can be done with

         perl Makefile.PL prefix=/usr/local
         make
         make install

This installs feedgnuplot to /usr/local. Adjust the paths as required
